                Hello there. My name is Bahaar Rokhva (you counted right, I have 4 a’s in my name). Very nice to
                virtually meet you. If you’re here to check out my design work hit the portfolio tab, quick. Before I
                launch into a long winded bio. While you’re there feel free to reach out if you have a project we could
                work together on.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now for the promised long winded bio. My first name means ‘spring’ in farsi. While my name is an import,
                I am not. I was born and raised in exotic Sandy, Utah (one of Salt Lakes’ 87 suburbs). I continued the
                Utah trend by going to the University of Utah, I graduated with a B.S. in Multidisciplinary Design.
                Which is a really verbose way of saying that I’ve come face to face with a whole spectrum of design
                (ranging from physical products to pixels) while in school. Currently I’m working as a UX designer, with
                pixels, buttons and typefaces, all of which I am equally passionate, and OCD about. At work I enjoy data
                visualization, long awkward pauses on conference calls and user research. Outside of work you’ll find me
                walking my adorable long bodied dog, Olive, and playing soccer.
